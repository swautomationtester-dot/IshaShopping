# ISHA Automation Practice - Static Site with Checkout Flow

This is a static, demo website inspired by demo.com with an end-to-end simulated checkout flow:
- Login (sessionStorage)
- Inventory with add-to-cart (localStorage)
- Cart page where you can change qty/remove items
- Checkout page with mock payment form
- Order confirmation page (orders stored in localStorage)

How to use:
1. Host on GitHub Pages or open `index.html` locally.
2. Login with `admin` / `admin123`.
3. Add items to cart, go to Cart -> Checkout -> Place order.

All data persists in browser storage (no server).
